        <p style="border: 1px; font-size: medium; font-style: italic; padding: 10px; margin:5px ;">Q #1) How can you reverse a string?

        <p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">
        Answer: String is reversed with the following algorithm:
        
        Initiate
        The string which is to be reversed is declared.
        Get the length of the string.
        Start a loop and then swap the position of the array elements.
        Keep the exchanged positions.
        Print the reversed string.</p>
       <p> Q #2) What is a palindrome string?</p>
        
        <P style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">Answer: After the string is reversed as discussed in Q #1, we need to put the following condition:
        
        Code snippet:
        
        if(actualtxt.equals(reversetxt)){
           return “Palindrome”;
        else
             return “Not Palindrome”;
        }
        Thus palindrome string is the one which on reversing remains the same, for example, – ‘madam’ is a palindrome string.</P>

        <p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">Answer: Two strings are called anagrams if they accommodate a similar group of characters in a varied sequence.
        
        To check if two strings are anagrams, the below steps are followed:
        
        Initialize two strings in two variables.
        Check if the length of the two strings is similar, if not then the strings are not an anagram.
        If the result is true, take the two strings and store them in a character array.
        Sort the two character arrays, then check if the two sorted arrays are alike.
        If the result is true, the two strings are anagram else, not anagram.
        Code snippet:
        
        if (str1.length() != str2.length()) {  
               System.out.println(str1 + " and " +str2 + " not anagrams string");

        (i) Take two strings i, j, and append them then store in the first string.
        
        (ii) Using the substring method extract the string:
        
        j = substring(0,i.length()-j.length())
        (iii) Store the string j in string i
        
        i= subsrtirng(j.length)
        Code snippet:
        
        string i = “abc”, j =”def”;
            i = i+j;
            j = i. substring(0,i.length()-j.length());
            i = i.substring(j.length())
           System.out.println(i +””+j);

    Q #21) How to traverse to the middle of a linked list?</p>
    <p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">

Answer: To traverse to the middle of a linked list the below steps are followed:

Declare two pointers first and second which are initialized to the linked list head.
Increment the first linked list by two nodes and second by one node in each loop.
While the first node reaches the end of the list, the second node will point to the middle.
Code snippet:

first = second = head; 
 while(first !=null) { 
    first = first.next; 
     if(first != null && first.next != null) { 
          second = second.next; 
          first = first.next; 
     } 
} 
 return second; 
  
}

<p>Q #22) Implement the process of reversing a linked list.
    </p>
    <p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">

Answer: A linked list can be reversed by the below steps:

Declare three nodes preceding, present, and following.
While in the present node, the preceding will be null.
Let the present.next be preceding to reverse the list.
In each looping, present and preceding are incremented by 1.
Code snippet:

Node preceding=null;
Node following
while(present!=null)
 {
     following=present.next;
     present.next=preceding;
     preceding=present;
     present=following;
  }
return preceding;
}

<p>Q #23) What is the process of deleting matched elements from a linked list which is not sorted.
</p>
<p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">
Answer: To delete matched elements from a linked list which is not sorted, the below steps are followed:

Travel from the head to the tail of the linked list.
For every value in the linked list, verify if it’s already present in the hash table.
If the result is true, the element is not added to the hash table.
Code snippet:

HashSet<Integer> h = new HashSet<>(); 
       
        node present = head; 
        node preceding = null; 
        while (present != null)  
        { 
            int presentval = present.value; 
              
            if (h.contains(presentval)) { 
                preceding.next = present.next; 
            } else { 
                h.add(presentval); 
                preceding = present; 
            } 
            present = present.next; 
        } 
   
    }

<p>Q #24) How to get the length of a linked list?
</p>
<p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">
Answer: To get the length of a linked list, the below steps are followed:

Start a counter with a value of 0 and present node as head.
Till the present node is not null , perform these :
present = present -> next
counter = counter + 1
Counter value is returned.
Code snippet:

{ 
        Node present = head; 
        int c = 0; 
        while (present != null) 
        { 
            c = c + 1; 
            present = present.next;

<p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">
Answer: To search a specific value in a linked list, the below steps are followed:

Declare present node as head.
Till the present node is not null, perform these :
present -> value is equal to the value being looked for return true.
present = present -> next.
If not found, false is returned.

<p>Q #26) How to verify if a number is prime or not?
</p>
<p style="border: 10px; background-color: azure; color: black; padding: 25px; margin:25px ;">
Answer: To verify if a number is prime or not, the below steps are followed:

Start a loop from value 2(k) up to (number / 2)
If the number is perfectly divisible by k, then the number is non – prime.
If the number is not perfectly divisible except for 1 and by itself, then the number is prime.
Code snippet:

for(k = 2; k <= number / 2; k++)
  {
      if(number % k == 0)
      {
          stat = false;
          break;
      }
  }
  if (stat)
     System.out.println("Prime";
       
  else
      System.out.println("Not prime");
